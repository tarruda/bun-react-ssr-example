# React SSR

The code here was taken from this npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bun-examples/react-ssr and demonstrates how one can implement a next.js like server using Bun's FileSystemRouter API.

Also did a bit of refactoring to improve development experience.

## Getting started

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

This starts the development server in watch mode. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.
